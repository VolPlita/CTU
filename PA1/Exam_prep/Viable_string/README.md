# Viable string

<i>This is a recursive task</i>

This one had its asserts and I cannot recreate them.

But the idea is that a STRING is considered viable if and only if the neighboring character for each of the characters are within 2 ASCII distance away. Like c can neighbor a,b,d,e.

You'll be given an string of arbitrary length. „?a???e“ for example. Then your task is recreate all the possibilities of such strings that conform to the requirement written above.

„baabce“, „caabce“, baacde„ is for example few of the valid examples.
